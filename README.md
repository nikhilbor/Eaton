The problem to solve is following:

                You monitor devices, which are sending data to you.

                Each device have a unique name.

                Each device produces measurements.

 

Challange is:

                Compute number of messages you got or read from the devices.

 

The solution can be in any language (preferably C/C++)

The scope is open, you must decide how the “devices” will work in your system.

The solution should be posted on GitHub or a similar page for a review.

Please add documentation explaining us how to run your code.


This code project demonstrates three devices which are Audio, Navigation and Weather
All the three devices will trigger singals which are moninotred by the client.
Everytime the signal is triggered we will monitor this signal and keep a count of the signal which is triggered.
also we will keep a count of total number of signals which are triggered
