The problem to solve is following:

                You monitor devices, which are sending data to you.

                Each device have a unique name.

                Each device produces measurements.

 

Challange is:

                Compute number of messages you got or read from the devices.

 

The solution can be in any language (preferably C/C++)

The scope is open, you must decide how the “devices” will work in your system.

The solution should be posted on GitHub or a similar page for a review.

Please add documentation explaining us how to run your code.
